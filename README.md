# parking-space-reservation
Wireframes for android app that aims at reserving parking spaces for two and four wheeler vehicles at two storey parking area.
1-2-3-5-6-7-4-8-9 is the flow for the wireframes. Since the user might be in a hurry he can use the barcode on his ID card as authentication.
Along with that traditional login ID and password functionality has also been provided. 
To provide exact location of a spot the rows are numbered while the columns are alphabetically named. Green color indicates vacant spot, 
red indicates occupied spot. The spot is reserved for next 15 minutes after the booking, this acts against unnecessary blocking of parking 
space in advance. Dashboards give details about number of spots available,occupied,etc for both two and four wheeler vehicles. A list of 
previous reservations can also be seen in the 'your list of bookings' tab.
